## Database Selection:

- **No Fixed Structure:** The event can be for price update or discount update or some other updates. Since the structure is not fixed, NOSQL would give us more flexibility


- **Fast Access -** To support low latency, on high throughput, NoSQL is a better choice


- **Simple Query Pattern -** we will most query with a product/discount/update/user id or by lastUpdatedTime. For such simple queries NoSQL is perfect

Hence we can go with MongoDB.
